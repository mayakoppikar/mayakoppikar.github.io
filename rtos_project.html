      <h2>RTOS for Formula 1 Robot</h2>
      <p>This project focuses on building a real-time operating system (RTOS) for a Formula 1 robot. I worked on the OS Kernel and Memory Manager and then joined a team of 5 to develop a race strategy and compete against 10-15 teams. This project was part of a graduate ECE Class at UT Austin called Embedded Real-Time Systems and took us around 4 months (January 2025- April 2025) to complete. </p>

      <h6>Key Features</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Task scheduling with priority-based preemption</li>
        <li>Motor control via PWM</li>
        <li>Sensor fusion from LIDARs</li>
        <li>Interfacing via CAN bus</li>
      </ul>

      <h6>Tech Stack</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Programming: C, ARM Assembly</li>
        <li>Hardware: TM4C Microcontroller</li>
        <li>Environment: ARM Keil uVision </li>
        <li>RTOS Concepts: Scheduling, Semaphores, Queues</li>
      </ul>

      <h6>Design Process</h6>
      <ol>
        <li>OS Kernel: </li>
        <li>Memory Management: We implemented a File Allocation Table (FAT) file system abstraction to manage memory. In order to implement processes in our RTOS, we worked on a SPI driver for an SD card. Doing so, I learned about the SPI protocol. This is a SPI Packet frame captured from our logic analyzer. <img src="images/spi_packets.png" alt="SPI Packet" class="img-fluid mb-3"> Later we wrote code to implement the FAT. This involves creating a directory to store file metadata (files names, sizes, starting locations) and 512 byte chunks where data is stored. Below is a high-level block-diagram of our system <img src="images/diagram_fat.png" alt="FAT Diagram" class="img-fluid mb-3"></li>
        <li>Sensor Data Acquisition: </li>
        <li>Motor Control and Race Strategy: </li>
        <li>Testing & Tuning: </li>
      </ol>

      <h6>Major Challenges & Key Takeaways</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>OS Kernel Bugs: Our kernel has overcome many bugs. Some of the most notable (and hardest to debug) were leaving OS Sleep and Kill functions within interrupts, branching to null address pointers when all tasks are sleeping, and conetxt switching within an interrupt instead of after exiting the interrupt handler.</li>
        
        <li>Motor PWM: Towards the end, after we implemented differential steering, we often ran into cases where the MCU would reset and the code would enter the Hard Fault Handler. The reason for this is that when we set our motor PWM duty cycle above 80-90%, this would draw too much current and cause the MCU to reset. We fixed this by capping our duty cycle to 80%.  </li>
        
        <li>Key Takeaways + Skils:
          <ul>
            <li>Using logic analyzers and other minimally intrusive debug techniques</li>
            <li>Reading the disassembly window + understanding compiler optimizations </li>
            <li>Reading sensor datasheets to write drivers!</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

        <h4>The Initial Run</h4>

        </div>
        <p>April 12,2025: This is our robot's first run... At this stage it collided into many walls, which we learnt was mainly because we had not (yet) tuned our PID controller. </p>

      <!-- Demo 2 -->
      <div class="col-md-4 mb-4">
        <h4>A Few Iterations In</h4>

        </div>
        <p>April 15, 2025: At this stage, our robot is moving much faster... By now, we have added differential steering allow for much faster, tighter turns. Also, adding a back-up subroutine was a game-changer, allowing for even higher motor speeds.</p>
